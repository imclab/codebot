  In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.        1<br /><img src="images/blackdot.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="" /><br /> x   +   1<br /><img src="images/blackdot.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="" /><br /> y   =   1<br /><img src="images/blackdot.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="" /><br /> n        It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of n for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.  What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?  NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of problem 108 and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.
