  Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular hexagon with side length 1.      <img src="project/images/p_354_bee_honeycomb.png" />          One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.<br />  For a positive real number L, let B(L) count the cells with distance L from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate for any distance we wish to consider. <br />  For example, B(<img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />3) = 6, B(<img src='images/symbol_radic.gif' width='14' height='16' alt='&radic;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />21) = 12 and B(111 111 111) = 54.    Find the number of L <img src='images/symbol_le.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&le;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 5&middot;1011 such that B(L) = 450.
