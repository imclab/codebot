  If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.  {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}  For which value of p <img src='images/symbol_le.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&le;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
