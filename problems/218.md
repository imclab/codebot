  Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.  The area of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.<br />  Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.<br />  Also c is a perfect square.    We will call a right angled triangle perfect if<br />  -it is a primitive right angled triangle<br />  -its hypotenuse is a perfect square    We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if<br />  -it is a perfect right angled triangle and<br />  -its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.      How many perfect right-angled triangles with c<img src='images/symbol_le.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&le;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />1016 exist that are not super-perfect?
